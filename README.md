# Understanding Customers through Behavior-Based Clustering

## About
---
This particular model has been designed with the primary purpose of assisting banking industries in effectively dividing their customer base into distinct segments. Its core functionality revolves around the ability to streamline and automate the process of identifying the most suitable products for individual customers, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual data grouping.

[The datasets that I use is from 1999 Czech Financial dataset.](https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions)

This data is from a Czech bank from 1999 with real anonymized transactions. I've chosen to work with this dataset because it's freely available to the public and contains a wealth of information about their banking customers.
